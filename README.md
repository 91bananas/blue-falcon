# Multi-Blue

A Bluetooth Kotlin Multiplatform library for iOS and Android. 

Bluetooth in general has the same functionality for all platforms, e.g. connect to device, fetch services, fetch characteristics.

This library is the glue that brings those together so that mobile developers can use one common api to perform the bluetooth actions.
