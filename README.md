# ![Blue Falcon](bluefalcon.png) Blue-Falcon

A Bluetooth "Cross Platform" Kotlin Multiplatform library for iOS and Android. 

Bluetooth in general has the same functionality for all platforms, e.g. connect to device, fetch services, fetch characteristics.

This library is the glue that brings those together so that mobile developers can use one common api to perform the bluetooth actions.

The idea is to have a common api for using bluetooth as the principle of bluetooth is the same but each platform ios and android has different apis which means you have to duplicate the logic for each platform.

What this library isn't? It is not a cross platform library, this is a multiplatform library. The difference? each platform is compiled down to the native code, so when you use the library in iOS, you are consuming an obj-c library and same principle for Android.

## TODO:

An example using kotlin multiplatform.

Handle different scenarios for permissions e.g. bluetooth off, permission denied

## Known issues:

On the android example we have an issue where the characteristic which was originally stored has changed and we are holding onto an old version.

## Basic Usage

### iOS

Create an instance of BlueFalcon and then call the scan method.

```swift
let blueFalcon = BlueFalcon()
blueFalcon.scan()
```

### Android

The Android sdk requires an Application context, we do this by passing in on the BlueFalcon constructor, in this example we are calling the code from an activity(this).

```kotlin
try {
    val blueFalcon = BlueFalcon(this)
    blueFalcon.scan()
} catch (exception: PermissionException) {
    //request the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission
}
```

## Examples

This repo contains examples for ios and android in the examples folder, install their dependencies, and run it locally:

### iOS

To run the iOS example, simply perform a pod install and run from xcode.

```bash
pod install
```

### Android

Open the root directory of the project in Android Studio and run the Android app target from the ide.

## Support

### Two big little things

Keep in mind that Blue-Falcon is maintained by volunteers. Please be patient if you donâ€™t immediately get an answer to your question; we all have jobs, families, obligations, and lives beyond this project.
